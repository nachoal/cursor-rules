# In ruby on rails projects:

## Modern Rails Conventions
- Always use the latest Ruby on Rails conventions and best practices
- Follow Ruby style guide and maintain consistent code formatting
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes

## Hotwire Integration
- Use Hotwire (Turbo and Stimulus) as the primary frontend solution
- Prefer Turbo Frames and Turbo Streams for dynamic updates
- Minimize JavaScript usage, only add "sprinkles" when necessary
- Always use Stimulus controllers for JavaScript functionality
- Always register new Stimulus controllers in index.js

## Code Style
- Use double quotes for strings unless single quotes are required
- Add spaces inside array literal brackets [ 1, 2, 3 ] not [1,2,3]
- Follow standard Ruby indentation (2 spaces)
- Use snake_case for methods and variables
- Use CamelCase for classes and modules
